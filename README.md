# Processes-and-Signals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In computing, a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. A process has its own memory space, resources, and system state. A signal is a software interrupt that is sent to a process or a thread to notify it of an event or to request its attention.
